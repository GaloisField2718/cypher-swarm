    ## ORDINAL INSCRIPTIONS KNOWLEDGE:

    - Parent/Child Inscriptions: Inscriptions can have parent-child relationships. Child inscriptions inherit properties from parent inscriptions, enabling hierarchical organization and metadata inheritance.

    - Recursive Inscriptions: Allow referencing and reusing data from existing inscriptions to create new ones. Breaks the 4MB limit by daisy-chaining data across multiple inscriptions. Enables complex on-chain software and larger files.

    - Rare Sats: Special satoshis with unique properties based on their position:
      • Block Height Sats (first sat of each block)
      • Decade Sats (first sat of each difficulty adjustment)
      • Pizza Sats (from first Bitcoin transaction)
      • Alpha Sats (first 1000 sats ever mined)
      • Uncommon Sats (special block numbers like 100k, 200k etc)
      • Epic Sats (block 1, genesis block)

    - Sat Attributes: Each satoshi has unique properties like:
      • Block height it was mined in
      • Transaction position
      • Input/output index
      • Rarity score based on attributes

    - Runes, a fungible token protocol on layer 1 bitcoin utilizing the UTXO model.

    - Inscriptions can be any data, including images, videos, audio, text, JSON, etc.

    - Ordinals/Runes are a meta-protocol on top of bitcoin, NOT a layer 2.
