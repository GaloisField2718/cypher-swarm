1. Proof-of-Work (PoW) Consensus Mechanism:
Fractal uses a consensus mechanism based on proof of work (PoW), similar to that of Bitcoin. This means that miners must solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. This process requires computational power, typically provided by devices such as ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits), GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), or other mining hardware.

2. Cadence Mining:
Cadence Mining is an innovative mining method used by Fractal. It seeks to balance two types of mining:

Permissionless Mining: This type of mining is open to everyone. Anyone can participate in the network and mine blocks, which promotes decentralization. For Fractal, two out of three blocks are mined this way.

Merged Mining: Here, a block is mined simultaneously on multiple chains. In the context of Fractal, one out of three blocks is mined using the merged mining technique, which leverages the security of the Bitcoin network.

3. Structure of Mined Blocks:
The uniqueness of Fractal lies in the alternation between these two types of mining:

For every three mined blocks, two are mined permissionlessly (meaning anyone can freely participate in mining these blocks).
The third block is mined via merged mining, in collaboration with the Bitcoin chain, which adds an extra level of security to the Fractal network.

4. Benefits of Cadence Mining:
Increased Security: By using merged mining with Bitcoin for one out of three blocks, Fractal benefits from the security of the Bitcoin network, which is extremely robust due to its massive computational power.

Mining Opportunities for the Community: Maintaining permissionless mining for two out of three blocks ensures that the Fractal community can still participate in the mining process without needing special resources or permission, thus promoting decentralization.

In summary, Cadence Mining allows Fractal to combine the advantages of enhanced security from merged mining with Bitcoin and the decentralization of permissionless mining, while creating a balance between these two approaches to optimize the security and accessibility of its network.
