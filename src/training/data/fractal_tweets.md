🔍 Trust Through Transparency: Introducing Fractal Treasury Timelocks

Big milestone for Fractal’s 3rd month: We're taking transparency to the next level, beyond wallet addresses! 👛

Starting December, we are implementing timelocks (using OP_CLTV) that will secure fund distribution of Ecosystem Treasury & Community Grants over the next 10 years.

🔒 Tiered Timelock (up to 10 years):

• Funds can't be moved before their time
• Maximum 10% disbursed per year
• Funds locked until specific block heights
• Enforced and verifiable on-chain
• Tracked transparently via our site

Stay tuned for updates as we roll this out starting December in phases!

Due to the technical complexity of timelock operations for large funds, we'll be executing this carefully and systematically.

📊 Track treasury movements on-chain, in real-time.

While we grow our mascot, we’re also gearing up to launch our voting platform powered by OP_CAT! 🔧

Want to participate in community decisions? Here’s how it works!

The process is simple:
1️⃣ Lock FB to unique address
2️⃣ Vote with no transaction fees
3️⃣ When ready, unlock to time-locked address
4️⃣ Claim after 7-day  (21,000 blocks) cooling period

All powered by Bitcoin script + OP_CAT! 🔒

Why the 7-day cooling period? Simple!

It prevents double voting by ensuring your FB can't be quickly recycled for the same proposal. Most votes end within 7 days, keeping things fair. 🎯

Pro tip: You’ll need FB to participate when votes go live 🤓

The tech is sophisticated (OP_CAT + unique addresses + time locks) but the user experience is seamless. No snapshots needed — just lock your FB and start voting!

💥 Fractal Community Grant will provide 6000 FB to support the PizzaSwap LPfest Epoch 1. Liquidity depositors over the 14-day period will be eligible for these rewards. 🎉

PizzaSwap stands as a cornerstone of the Fractal ecosystem, uniquely positioned as the only DEX that supports trading of all Fractal assets — from brc-20 and Runes to CAT20 and beyond. 🌈

PizzaSwap's comprehensive support ensures a unified trading experience for the entire Fractal ecosystem. This universal compatibility and support, combined with our belief in the importance of decentralized liquidity, is why we're committing 6000 FB from our community grants to support liquidity providers.

PizzaSwap is built with a flexible, modular design that prioritizes both security and performance. Each module operates independently, separating trading activity from fund management to ensure smooth, uninterrupted operations.

📍 Based on feedback from the community, we will be supporting this promotion with the following pairs:
🔸 sFB <> sBTC
🔸 sFB <> sSATS
🔸 sFB <> Glizzy

🔗 Please review the PizzaSwap official documentation and product details before participating in the promotion. 
https://t.co/DDjbGUJhXP

⚖️ Transparency Note: As part of our commitment to transparency, all Fractal treasury funds can be verified by checking the official addresses listed in our documentation at https://t.co/13Vjr0uJaw. We encourage community members to review these addresses to track the distribution of community grants and other treasury activities.✨

👏It's one month since Fractal's mainnet launch!

🪧 Here's a recap of what we've built so far:
⚒️ 35% of Bitcoin's Hashpower: We’ve maintained a consistently impressive merged mining hashrate of around 250 EH/s. For permissionless mining, we’re at 7.1 EH/s.

🏛️ Core Infrastructure: We successfully launched an explorer, marketplace, wallet, inscription platform, simple bridge, PizzaSwap, and more for our Fractal ecosystem.

🟠 3 Protocols: At the protocol level, we already support protocols like BRC-20, Runes, and CAT Protocol.

👥 Active & Growing: Over 37,000,000 addresses created and a total of 300,000,000 transactions since launch. Currently, Fractal maintains 750,000 active addresses (24H) and 16,000,000 transactions (24H). We also have 140+ projects in our ecosystem.

🔜 What’s next?

🌉 Introducing Fractal's Bridging Options

As Fractal’s mainnet gains momentum, we’re excited to introduce Fractal's bridging solutions. These bridges enable seamless asset transfers between Fractal and other blockchain networks, ensuring secure and efficient value movement. Fractal now has two bridging solutions, Simple Bridge and Bool Bridge.

🔗 Why Bridges Matter for Fractal
Fractal was designed to scale Bitcoin infinitely, without compromising security. Fractal’s bridges enable transfers between Bitcoin, Fractal, and other chains — crucial for expanding DeFi, gaming, and more.

🌐 Cross-Chain Transfers Made Easy
With bridging options, users can move assets between Bitcoin and Fractal, all while leveraging Bitcoin’s security and Fractal’s scalability. This ensures smooth, fast transactions and interaction across multiple chains — optimizing the user experience on Fractal.

🟠 Simple Bridge on Fractal
Simple Bridge, developed by @unisat_wallet, is a small service designed to securely and efficiently connect assets from different protocols to PizzaSwap. By integrating the latest cryptographic algorithms, Simple Bridge enhances the security and performance of cross-chain asset transfers, bringing innovation to the blockchain ecosystem. 

💡 Bool Bridge on Fractal
Bool Bridge by @bool_official uses Dynamic Hidden Committee (DHC) technology, integrating Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP), MPC (Multi-Party Computation), and Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) for fully decentralized validation. It ensures secure, anonymous, and randomized validation of transactions.

🌟 What’s Next for Bridges on Fractal?
Fractal is opening new doors for secure transfer of assets to and from both Bitcoin and Fractal, in a decentralized, scalable way. Fractal will continue to support multiple bridging solutions that are suitable for developers and their needs. Whether you're into DeFi, gaming, or using Bitcoin more efficiently, bridges can help you unlock these possibilities.

Stay tuned as Fractal continues to expand its bridging solutions, empowering the community to build, transact, and innovate on Bitcoin!🔥

We received some user feedback regarding the incomplete filling of blocks on Fractal mainnet. We immediately launched an investigation.

Here’s more details on what happened:  Miners generally prioritize high-fee transactions and are subject to two block size constraints: 1) the maximum block size in bytes, 2) the maximum number of SIG operations. When faced with a large amount of high-fee MULTISIG transactions, blocks can reach the SIG limit of 80,000 and can no longer include more transactions.

🔸 Typically, a Segregated Witness (SegWit) transaction consumes 1 SIG,  allowing a theoretical maximum of 80,000 transactions in a block (80,000/1=80,000). This far exceeds the norm, so the SIG limit is rarely observed in practice.  
🔸 A transaction that includes MULTISIG consumes 84 SIGs, meaning that if a block is fully filled with such transactions, the maximum number of transactions in a block would be reduced to 80,000/84 = 952. This results in blocks bytes not fully packed.

We observed that certain random blocks were fully packed because they included low-fee transactions that were not MULTISIG. These transactions filled the remaining 75% of the block space, leading to an approximate 20% increase in the total block fees.

Such occurrence is a result of the existing mechanisms on the BTC mainnet and not a bug with the Fractal explorer. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and work on improving network connectivity and performance.

📢 brc-20 on Fractal is Now Open Sourced!

Following the #Ordinals open-source release on September 14th, we are now releasing the brc-20 on #Fractal implementation. This release is here to help developers easily analyze and build applications related to brc-20 on Fractal.

📍Key features of this source code release:
🔸 brc-20 on Fractal with specific rules (detailing differences from Bitcoin mainnet rules)
🔸 Full event stream, including the swap module (beneficial for DeFi projects utilizing #PizzaSwap liquidity)

🔗GitHub link:
https://t.co/PaEGZgM5xA

(Note: For performance reasons, this is an isolated branch specifically for brc-20.)

Building on the open-source implementations for Ordinals, brc-20, and other protocols, we will continue to release additional protocol implementations for Fractal, like the Runes protocol indexing component, to gradually create a developer-friendly source code framework.✨

Stay tuned for more updates!

📢Fractal Tokenomics In More Detail 

As we approach the major milestone of our mainnet launch (in ~11 hours! 🤩), we want to further clarify the details around Fractal's tokenomics in response to community questions. Transparency is key for us, and we’re here to provide all the answers. Let’s dive in! 👇

🔸Mining Schedule: We've outlined the detailed mining schedule for Fractal’s proof-of-work model, ensuring a clear understanding of how mining rewards are distributed over time.
🔸Token Allocation Limits: The allocation for the Ecosystem Treasury and Community Grants is capped at a maximum of 10% of the total allocation per year, spread over 10 years. The allocation for Advisors is capped at a maximum of 20% of the total allocation per year, spread over 5 years. This approach is designed to provide long-term support and sustainability for the Fractal ecosystem.
🔸Pre-sale and Team Unlock Schedule: We want to reiterate that the unlock schedule for pre-sale and team tokens has always been clearly defined from the beginning. As specified in the terms, these tokens are set to begin unlocking at the end of the 7th month and will be released linearly until the end of the 12th month. This schedule is a fundamental part of our tokenomics design, ensuring transparency and alignment with our community from day one.
🔸Transparency on Fractal Addresses: We’ve also included a comprehensive list of all official Fractal addresses. This will help our community verify token movements and maintain transparency.

We’re committed to keeping our community informed and appreciate your ongoing support as we grow together. If you have more questions or feedback, feel free to reach out!✨

💡 OP_CAT on #Fractal Bitcoin❔

OP_CAT is a potential significant improvement for #Bitcoin script programmability. Technically, we're prepared to deliver OP_CAT on Fractal Bitcoin and are considering activating it upon the mainnet launch in September. This would allow projects to implement high-level contract features on Fractal from day one.

As an extension to the Bitcoin blockchain, one intriguing use case of Fractal Bitcoin is enabling experimental features (such as OP_CAT), which opens up dozens of programmable possibilities, and provides real-world lessons for Bitcoin Core developers before re-enabling such changes to the Bitcoin mainnet. It's even better when these features can be conducted without breaking the transaction-level compatibility between different layers, by executing OP_CAT-enabled scripts conditionally within TapRoot environment.💡

We would love to hear your thoughts on activating OP_CAT at the Fractal Bitcoin mainnet launch. Please cast your vote and share your valuable reasons behind the choice in the comments. 🧡

📢 About testnet tokens

We're thrilled to see the excitement around the #Fractal faucet! We can't wait to share more updates on the testnet with you all.🎈

Before the Fractal mainnet launch, the current testnet will undergo several resets. At this stage, testnet tokens are only distributed to an initial group of developers testing core functionalities. Testnet tokens do not have any real value or incentives, and will not be translated in any way to the mainnet.

The testnet will be open to everyone soon, giving you plenty of time to experience it. 🛫

Stay tuned to Fractal's updates for more info on the testnet. We'll keep you posted!💫

✨ Highlights of Fractal

#Fractal is the first instance of a virtualization methodology applied to #Bitcoin in the world.

Fractal gradually extends the Bitcoin blockchain into a scalable computing system without breaking consistency with the Bitcoin main chain.

🧩Native

Recursive scaling of Bitcoin Core code itself — without any foreign constructs — ensures consistent and unlimited scaling, and native support of current infrastructure (e.g. wallets).

Additionally, due to this consistency across layers, assets can be directly transferred from layer to another without the need for additional relays.

🎓The Zen of Fractal Bitcoin

Bitcoin is a blockchain. Over years, it could evolve into a system.

It's always good to extend bitcoin, not fork it away.

Maintaining consistency with the mainnet matters.

Virtualization is not just a metaphor; it's the practical approach itself.

Fractal Bitcoin facilitates conventions, not contentions.

Faster transaction confirmations save everyone's time.

If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.

Always balance the load between the bitcoin mainnet and a given fractal instance.

Real-world transactions are on par with high-level financial constructs, if not more so.
