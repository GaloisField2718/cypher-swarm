[1/26] Satoshi Nakamoto created OP_CAT in 2009 when creating Bitcoin.

He then disabled it in 2010.  
Now, Tapscript enables it again. 

Only a small circle of people know about its capabilities yet‚Ä¶

The potential is insane though‚Ä¶ üëá https://t.co/LnlaPmMG5u

[3/26] What is OP_CAT?

OP_CAT was once a part of Bitcoin‚Äôs scripting language but was disabled in 2010. Thanks to Tapscript, it‚Äôs making a comeback.
---

[4/26] @adam3us talked about it some time ago as well!
---

[5/26] In October 2023, a proposal came up to reintroduce OP_CAT as an opcode for tapscript by redefining the existing opcode OP_SUCCESS126. https://t.co/1b5Wpy6e6G

[6/26] Tapscript is the scripting language used for Taproot-enabled transactions. 

Here you can find the proposal:

[7/26] What is OP_CAT?

OP_CAT is set to innovate Bitcoin by bringing smart contract capabilities to Bitcoin, expanding its potential for Layer 2 applications.
---

[8/26] Imagine taking two pieces of data and instantly merging them into one - that‚Äôs exactly what OP_CAT does.
---

[9/26] Whether you‚Äôre working with strings, numbers, or other data, OP_CAT simplifies the process, making it easier to handle complex operations.
---

[10/26] But there‚Äôs a twist. 

OP_CAT was disabled in Bitcoin‚Äôs early days because it could create scripts that consumed too much memory.
---

[11/26] Thanks to Tapscript, the issue is resolved. Tapscript limits stack elements to 520 bytes, making OP_CAT not only safe but a game-changer for Bitcoin.
---

[12/26] Picture this: a script with OP_CAT could turn a tiny 1-byte value into a monstrous 1-terabyte stack value! 

To prevent this from happening, OP_CAT was shelved - until now.
---

[13/26] But why does it matter?
 
OP_CAT is more than just a cool code; it‚Äôs set to redefine what‚Äôs possible on the Bitcoin network. 

Here‚Äôs how:
---

[14/26] 1. Enhanced Script Capabilities

With OP_CAT, developers can now build and manipulate larger integers directly within Bitcoin scripts.
---

[15/26] This opens up endless possibilities for applications that rely on complex number operations.
---

[16/26] 2. Zero-Knowledge Applications

Zero-knowledge proofs (zkProofs) are the future of privacy and security in blockchain.
---

[17/26] OP_CAT makes it easier to create and verify these proofs by simplifying the process of building complex data structures.
---

[18/26] By enabling more complex scripts, OP_CAT paves the way for BitVM - a concept that could bring Ethereum-like smart contracts to Bitcoin
---

[19/26] 3. BitVM: Bringing Smart Contracts to Bitcoin

Smart contracts have long been Ethereum‚Äôs playground, but OP_CAT could change that.
---

[20/26] 4. Decentralized Staking with

OP_CAT could help build more robust and decentralized staking mechanisms by making it easier to construct and evaluate so called ‚Äúslashing conditions‚Äù
---

[21/26] BUT: 

As exciting as OP_CAT is, not everyone is on board. Major changes to Bitcoin require community consensus, and some people prefer a more minimalist approach.
---

[22/26] They argue that Bitcoin should prioritize other softforks that focus on core issues like scalability and privacy rather than adding new functionalities.
---

[23/26] Tbh I‚Äôve never seen so much development happening on Bitcoin before.
---

[24/26] Despite the debate, the hype around OP_CAT is definitely there. 

As Bitcoin continues to evolve with innovations like Ordinals and Runes, OP_CAT could play a crucial role in pushing its capabilities even further.
---

[25/26] There‚Äôs a telegram group as well for people who are bundling with OP_CAT

@fractal_bitcoin @Cointelegraph @hashrateindex OP_CAT reminds me of the OP_RETURN field we know from Runes. 

All of these things haven‚Äôt been used yet and the fact that it gets used now, makes me feel like a renaissance is happening.
