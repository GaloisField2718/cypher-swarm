TO DO:
- create dream system - an agent that loads in learnings daily per category [and each user], reflects/summarizes, and stores in supabase db. every day the new learnings condense into the existing learnings, adjusting the core system prompt on a daily basis. (can be done later)
- log the token usage per agent, somehow
- log the schema outputs of every agent when they run in pipelines, so we can visualize it on site
- update site so we get new terminal and functionalities
- make the agent system for CORE agents configurable for new user modalarity
- make the media gen system easily configurable for new user modalarity
- look into bundling commands like replies from terminal agent so we can hammer out multiple replies at once
