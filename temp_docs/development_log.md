     - Added context messages to inform the summarization agent about the type of summarization being performed.

  2. **Database Adjustments**:
     - Identified and resolved an issue where long-term summaries weren't being saved due to a database constraint requiring `session_id` to be `NULL` for long-term summaries.
     - Adjusted `saveSummary` calls to pass `null` for `session_id` when saving long-term summaries, complying with the database constraint.
     - Enhanced error logging in `saveSummary` to capture and report database errors.
