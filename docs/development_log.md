### Summary

- **Topic**: Re-Making the Terminal Command System and Documentation Structure

- **Description**: We made a terminal command system from scratch. This allows both the AI agent and human users to use the terminal seamlessly. Additionally, we established a documentation system to capture the development process and architecture, aiding new AI agents or developers in understanding and contributing to the project effectively.

- **Decisions Made**:
  - Implemented a dynamic command registration system.
  - Enhanced command definitions to include metadata and parameter information.
  - Created a `docs/` directory with key documentation files.
  - Decided on a structure for summarizing conversations and design decisions.

### Summary

- **Topic**: Twitter Client Functionality and Terminal Integration

- **Description**: Implemented the Twitter client functionality by organizing each Twitter function into its own dedicated module within the `twitterFunctions` directory. These functions are now integrated into the terminal command system, enhancing modularity and maintainability.

- **Decisions Made**:
  - Created individual modules for each Twitter function in `src/twitter/twitterFunctions/`.
  - Updated the terminal command registry to include the new Twitter functions.
  - Ensured that each terminal command corresponding to a Twitter function is properly documented and commented.

### Summary

- **Topic**: Complete Agent System Implementation

- **Description**: Built the entire agent system from the ground up, creating a robust framework for AI agents to interact with various interfaces, starting with Twitter. The system is designed to be modular, extensible, and maintainable.

- **Key Components Implemented**:
  - BaseAgent class with core functionality for all agents
  - Model adapters for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Fireworks
  - Terminal Agent with Twitter integration
  - Comprehensive tool system matching OpenAI's function calling format
  - Message history management
  - Dynamic configuration system
  - Robust error handling and logging

- **Architectural Decisions**:
  - Used inheritance pattern with BaseAgent for maximum reusability
  - Implemented adapter pattern for different AI model providers
  - Created standardized tool schemas using Zod
  - Separated configuration from implementation
  - Built with TypeScript for type safety

- **Documentation**:
  - Created clear, concise documentation in `agents.md`
  - Added examples and best practices
  - Documented system architecture and component interactions
  - Included practical usage examples
