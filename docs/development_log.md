### Summary

- **Topic**: Twitter Client Functionality and Terminal Integration

- **Description**: Implemented the Twitter client functionality by organizing each Twitter function into its own dedicated module within the `twitterFunctions` directory. These functions are now integrated into the terminal command system, enhancing modularity and maintainability.

- **Decisions Made**:
  - Created individual modules for each Twitter function in `src/twitter/twitterFunctions/`.
  - Updated the terminal command registry to include the new Twitter functions.
  - Ensured that each terminal command corresponding to a Twitter function is properly documented and commented.

### Summary

- **Topic**: Implemented Hierarchical Memory System

- **Description**: Created a comprehensive memory system that manages short-term, mid-term, and long-term summaries through a unified database structure. The system supports the AI's ability to maintain and process memories at different time scales, with historical tracking of long-term memory evolution.

- **Key Components**:
  1. Database Structure:
     - Single unified `memory_summaries` table
     - Supports three types of summaries: short, mid, and long
     - Tracks processing status and relationships
     - Maintains chronological order of memories
     - Preserves historical long-term memories

  2. Memory Management Functions:
     - `saveSummary`: Store new summaries of any type
     - `getUnprocessedSummaries`: Retrieve summaries ready for processing
     - `markSummariesAsProcessed`: Track processed summaries
     - `updateLongTermSummary`: Create new long-term memory while preserving history
     - `getActiveMemories`: Retrieve current memory state (5-3-1 structure)

  3. Memory Processing Flow:
     - Short-term: Up to 5 most recent unprocessed summaries
     - Mid-term: Up to 3 most recent unprocessed summaries
     - Long-term: Latest unprocessed summary, with history preserved

- **Design Decisions**:
  - Used single table design for better data consistency
  - Separated database operations from AI processing logic
  - Implemented processed flag to track summary status
  - Made system session-aware for context tracking
  - Preserved long-term memory history for evolution tracking
  - Designed for asynchronous processing

- **Technical Details**:
  - Removed single long-term constraint to allow history
  - Added specific index for latest unprocessed long-term retrieval
  - Chronological ordering via created_at timestamps
  - Null session_id allowed for long-term memories
  - Type safety through TypeScript interfaces
  - Error handling and logging throughout

- **Memory Processing Rules**:
  1. Every 5 short-term summaries get processed into 1 mid-term summary
  2. Every 3 mid-term summaries get processed into new long-term memory
  3. Previous long-term memory gets marked as processed when new one is created
  4. Only unprocessed summaries are considered for active memory
  5. Historical long-term memories are preserved for tracking evolution

- **Next Steps**:
  - Implement AI processing logic for summary generation
  - Add memory cleanup/archival system
  - Create monitoring tools for memory system health
  - Add memory retrieval optimization
  - Add visualization tools for memory evolution
  - Implement memory analysis tools to track cognitive development
